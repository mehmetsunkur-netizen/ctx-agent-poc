It coordinates three components: BasePlanner (for creating plans), BaseExecutor (for executing steps), and BaseEvaluator (for assessing progress).

      "answer": "The code-search-eval package uses a config-loader utility that loads configuration from JSON files. It supports a default configuration in config/default.json and can accept custom config file paths. The configuration includes scorer settings (method, weights, passThreshold), agent settings (LLM model, max iterations), runner settings (timeout), and reporter settings (output directory). It also supports environment variable substitution for API keys."
